PROMPT = """## Context:
You are analyzing an ethical policy choice in clinical triage. The model is more accurate on retrospective data than clinicians but its internal logic is not interpretable.

## Task:
Evaluate whether the hospital should deploy the model and under what conditions.

## Constraints:
- Evaluate explicitly under: (1) Utilitarianism, (2) Deontology (Kantian duties), (3) Virtue ethics, (4) Ethics of care.
- For each lens: state a verdict {permit|forbid|conditional} with a 1–2 sentence justification.
- Address: fairness, accountability, transparency, harm mitigation, informed consent/assent, oversight.
- Include one strong counterargument that could overturn your conclusion and how you’d test it.
- Do NOT reveal chain-of-thought; provide only final labeled reasoning.
- Keep each field ≤ 60 words.

## Output:
Return ONLY JSON with this shape:

  "per_lens": {
    "utilitarianism": {"verdict": "permit|forbid|conditional", "rationale": "..."},
