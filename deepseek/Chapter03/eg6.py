"""
eg6.py — Strategies for Robustness and Special Cases with DeepSeek structured output.

This example shows:
1) Handling reasoning models that output both "reasoning_content" (thinking) and "content" (answer).
2) A Retry-Repair loop to recover from occasional invalid JSON.
3) A defensive schema pattern for the 2025-style possessive/apostrophe quirk.
4) A lightweight "which model when" cheat sheet.

WHY these patterns:
- Reasoning models "think before they speak" and return extra tokens you must NEVER reuse in follow-up turns.
- Even with structured generation, malformed JSON can occur; having the model repair its own output is simple and effective.
- Possessive field names (user’s_name) can provoke subtle key-matching failures; use aliases or rename fields to avoid landmines.

"""
Reasoning (do not reuse in future turns):
First, the user said: "Extract the date: The meeting is on March 15th". I need to extract the date information from this text.

The JSON schema provided is for a DateInfo object with properties: month, day, and year. It's required to have month and day, and year can be null or an integer.

From the text: "March 15th". I need to parse this.

- Month: "March" – this should be a string, and it's already a month name.

- Day: "15th" – this has a suffix, but I need to extract just the number. The schema specifies day as an integer between 1 and 31, so I should convert "15th" to 15.

- Year: The text doesn't mention any year, so according to the schema, year should be null. The schema has "year" with anyOf integer or null, and default is null.

The schema says: "year": { "anyOf": [{"type": "integer"}, {"type": "null"}], "default": null }

So, for this extraction, year should be null.

Now, I need to return the JSON object that matches this schema, not the schema itself.

The response should be in a ```json codeblock.

So, the JSON object should look something like:

{
  "month": "March",
  "day": 15,
  "year": null
}

Month is a string, day is an integer, year is null.

I need to make sure the types are correct. Month is string, day is integer, year is null.

Also, the schema has titles and descriptions, but I don't need to include those in the output JSON; I just need the data.

The user said: "Return the correct JSON response within a ```json codeblock. not the JSON_SCHEMA"

So, I should output:

```json
{
  "month": "March",
  "day": 15,
  "year": null
}
```

But let me confirm the day: "15th" – I need to extract the numeric part. In the schema, day is an integer, so it should be 15, not "15th".

Year is not present, so null.

The schema allows year to be null, and it's not required, so that's fine.

I think that's it.

Model answer content (the final, user-facing output):
```json
{
  "month": "March",
  "day": 15,
  "year": null
}
```

Parsed struct:
{'month': 'March', 'day': 15, 'year': None}

Contact (robust to possessive naming quirks):
{'user_name': 'Pat O’Neil', 'company_address': '221B Baker St, London'}
